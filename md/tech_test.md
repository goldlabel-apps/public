### The problem with technical tests in recruitment



I actually like them. I enjoy doing them and I think they're very useful. A combination of a 1 good interview and 1 good tech test is a good indicator of a good fit for a role. 

BUT

Employers have got a bit too used to this method of recruitment and in general people are starting to forget that a tech test is a big deal for a developer. 

It is invariably several hours work, and often much more. That means several hundred dollars worth of work that the developer is agreeing to do for free. That's fine too, all part of the unspoken agreement. As a developer I'm ok with that deal.

What I'm not OK with is what has happened to me twice over the past month, which is that I've spent time and effort on a test, submitted it as the client asked and then heard zero back for more than a week. That is bad form.

If you're a client and you ask a dev to take a test, then you commit to reviewing that test in good time and providing a considered response, good or bad. If you have a problem with it, I want to know exactly what that problem is so I can learn from it. If you think it's fine, but you found another candidate who you like better... also fine, I just need to know.

Bottom line is: when I do a technical test I think it's reasonable to expect a timely, considered response from the person who asked me to do it so that I don't feel like I've had my time wasted.

Employers seem to have become lazy about their responsibility in the bargain. They know that devs are timid and not likely to ring them up and give them shit if they just let the review slide.
