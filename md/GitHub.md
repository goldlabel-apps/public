#### GitHub

Working well in a team is even important when a team is remote. Fortunately GitHub (or Jira) 
makes it easy for everyone to work across different TimeZones asynchronously 

On this [Kanban Board](https://github.com/listingslab-software/advicator/projects/1) there are a number of Tasks. The goal (Milestone) is to progress all our Tasks to Done and thus complete the GitHub Milestone of __DevTest-Herbi Complete__

Using GitHub's [Project Management](https://github.com/features/project-management/) features, we create [New Tasks](https://github.com/listingslab-software/advicator/issues/new/choose) which get aded to the Kanban. In this scenario we decide that a Task represents a chunk of work which is ready to pass to developers
