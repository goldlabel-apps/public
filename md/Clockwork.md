## Clockwork

Sometimes you want to have an app which has a kind of a heartbeat. Perhaps you want to run an update routine evey few seconds or maybe you want something to happen after the user has had the app open for 30 seconds but not before

That is what Clockwork Hook does. It's simply a component that you drop into your app and when it's rendered it starts a timer ticking once every second. There's an API you can use to add events in the form of redux actions to get fired at particular times
