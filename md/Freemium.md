## A business mode for WordPress products

Freemium WordPress Products. Using the freemium business model enables you, the product owner, to enjoy both the distribution & marketing advantages of the free model, as well as the financial benefits of the premium world:

#### The Gift Of Free Users

One of the greatest benefits presented by the official WordPress plugin and theme repositories is the ease in which WordPress website owners can search and install the plugins or themes they require.

For the creators of those products, it’s a constant influx of incoming users who stumble upon their WordPress product, install it on their websites, and take it for a spin. If they think it’s any good after that – they will, most likely, keep it.

Many of you may be asking: Ok, but what’s so great about an influx of free users? 

How can they help me sustain my efforts and keep the lights on if they’re not paying me?

#### Great question. The short answer is: 

The worst thing that can happen is that one of those free users will decide to pay you some money and purchase one of your add-ons or upgrade to a paid license 

The slightly longer answer is: If you think about it when you host your free WordPress product version on the official WordPress.org repository – there’s no extra cost in it for you. It is securely hosted and served to your users for free (including version updates) – so, except for the burden of having to support free users (see the disadvantages section below), no harm done, and, at the same time, you’ll be gaining more exposure and users for your WordPress product.

Upgrades, Upsells, Up Up Up!
Upgrading free users into paying users is by far the most persuasive commercial argument to be made in favor of the freemium business model. Remember the influx of free users from the paragraph above? While they may not be paying you a dime, simply due to their being “free users”, it does not mean you cannot convert them into paying users/customers somewhere down the line. As a matter of fact, you should! I’ll even throw in a few tips on how to go about doing that:

Whether you choose to sell paid add-ons/extensions that add important functionality to your free core product, or you prefer to go with a free version that upgrades into a paid, premium one, you should optimize your free user’s experience and follow some CRO (Conversion Rate Optimization) best practices that will help “push” your free users to take the leap towards paying you money & upgrade.

Consider Offering A Trial Period
Trials are only offered by a small fraction of the premium/freemium WordPress plugins and themes on the market. The main reason is that the developers are required to handle and protect their products from piracy and trial abuse, especially inside the open-source ecosystem. Once that technical obstacle is handled (either by a monetization solution like Freemius or by the actual developer), free trials can massively improve sales and conversion rate from free to paid:

According to this pie-chart, trial conversions made up just over 25% of all transactions in March 2018 for IconicWP. That’s more than new sales (i.e. straight up purchases with no trial) at 23%.

If you’re going to provide an option for a free trial – it’s important to do so in a timely and friendly (non-intrusive and dismissable) manner. At Freemius, we show the following message on the free user’s WordPress admin dashboard only 24-hours after the activation event, so the product is still fresh in their minds, and at the same time, there’s a good chance that the user will have already tested a bunch of other alternatives:

It’s important to remember that, when offering free trials for a freemium WordPress plugin or theme –  trial expiration should not block all of the features, as you might when a user does not renew a premium-only product. The expected behavior when dealing with freemium products is to fall back to the free version.

When your free user considers the option of upgrading and purchasing a license to your premium version – you could facilitate their dilemma by offering them an option to take the premium features for a spin.

Offer A Moneyback Guarantee / Refund Policy
Offer a paid version of your WordPress product, but let people know that you have a Refund Policy available, if they’re not completely satisfied with the product. Just be sure to provide clear instructions about how they may request a refund.

- Make Sure The Upgrade from Free to Premium Is Seamless

WordPress users have come to expect an easy (seamless) WordPress products installation routine inside their admin dashboard, and you’d be smart to provide them with a similar experience when they come to upgrade your product. Here’s an example of how a seamless (in-dashboard) upgrade from free → Pro is done using the Freemius monetization system:

So, right from their WordPress admin, the free users can pick a premium plan, choose their preferred payment method and make an immediate upgrade to the paid version.

Even though it is not allowed to host & serve the premium parts of your product off of the WordPress.org repo – it does not mean your premium users should be redirected back and forth, in order to download, install and activate their recently purchased premium product version. The idea is to keep it intuitive so you can take advantage of all those free users who have found your product through the official WordPress.org repository, NOT losing anyone along the way.
