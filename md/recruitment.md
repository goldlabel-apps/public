That really does sound up my street, but there is a slight issue. Even though I’m a UK citizen and work outside IR35 contracts through my UK Ltd company, I’m not actually in the UK right now. 

In fact I’m in Australia. Having been here working for UK companies in this way over the past 12 months it’s clear that this - particularly managing the timezone difference - is crucial to the success of a contract.

Do you think that’s something your client might entertain?

That sounds like it could be a good fit and I'd like to find out more about the requirements

Hi Adam, it certainly sounds like a good fit & I'm in the market so long as it's 100% remote?
thanks

Unfortunately they are ideally looking at once a fortnightly visits to their office in London. Would that rule this option out?

It would. I've actually been working remotely for UK clients from Australia for the past year. As you can imagine, it takes a particular kind of client to entertain that idea

Thanks for getting back to me that makes, the commute could be a little difficult from there. 
Out of interest, what hours have you been working & have you been operating through a UK Ltd company?

Hi Adam,
Yes I've generally been working outside of IR35 with my UK ltd co

The timezone issue is the biggest bear trap, as you have noticed. Basically what has worked has been an overlapping daily standup meeting at start of play uk time (evening for me) and then working asynchronously using all the usual tools - Jira, GitHub / whatever to keep track of the work as it gets done

That does make sense, unfortunately for this position in particular I think even if they were to open up fully remote they would require someone on the same time zones for meetings etc.

Happy to share details of any other roles that could be a fit though. What rate would you normally go for?


I would welcome any other opportunities, thanks adam. As for rate, that's the up side. I can undercut any market rate and offer an unusual amount of experience for a reasonable cost
so although it depends on .... all the things it usually depends on, at the moment I'm considering anything upwards of 300/day as good money

If I were in london, blah blah. But I'm not and my rate expectations reflect that

That's good to know Chris, thanks for explaining. I will have a quick chat with the manager and see if it is something he could be open to for a reduced rate as its probably worth asking.

But if anything fully remote does arise I will certainly be back in touch. 


Hi Adam, Well I like the sound of gain theory a great deal. The only thing that I see as a possible issue is that they might be looking for someone with a more classical programming background. I've been coding for 20 years and I've touched on pretty much all the technologies they mention in the spec over the years, but i would do poorly in a technical interview because I don't talk like a programmer
but the positives far outweigh any negs

Thanks for the feedback Chris, well let me have a chat with him to see if they would be open to a Dev in Australia and then we can look to see if we could set up a quick call with the manager?

that sounds brilliant, thanks

Hi Chris,

I hope you are well.

I caught up with the manager regarding what we spoke about and unfortunately he is only willing to flex to a GMT +/- 2 time zone for this role.

If anything else pops up I'll be back in touch.

Hi Adam, thanks for giving it a shot, I'm glad we took the time to go through the situation. You never know when that right kind of client will show up and if & when they do .... regards, Chris
