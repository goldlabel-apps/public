## How to SFTP into the Herbivore WP Codebase

1. Open the Cloudways server managemnet platform [link](https://platform.cloudways.com/server). 
You should use your Advicator Google account for this

2. Navigate to the Herbivore 2 Install (type Herbivore V2 in search ) and look for 

> APPLICATION CREDENTIALS

These are the SFTP details you'll need to use to move files to and from the server

3. Open your FTP program [Cyberduck is good](https://cyberduck.io/). 

Connect to the server using the details you have copied from Cloudways using SFTP (keep default ports)

4. Files are located in the `public_html` 


Please use caution :)
