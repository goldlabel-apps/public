# Agile Development Cycle

## Step 1. Agile Management (scrum master)

- Identifying the issue, describing it and setting up the solution
- [Create GitHub Issue](https://github.com/listingslab-software/listingslab/issues/new/choose) 
- Assign Issue 

## Step 2. Development (engineer)

- Taking ownership of the issue (ball is in dev's court)
- Pull Request (ball back to the scrum master)
