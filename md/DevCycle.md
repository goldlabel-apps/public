# Listingslab Development Cycle

## Step 1. Agile Management

- Identifying the issue, describing it and setting up the solution
- [Create GitHub Issue](https://github.com/listingslab-software/listingslab/issues/new/choose) 
- Assign Issue (scrum master)

## Step 2. Development

- Taking ownership of the issue (ball is in dev's court)
- Pull Request (ball back to the scrum master)
