> Cool Shit Jira & Bitbucket does for free

- Boards. Which are basically Trello boards, but better. The Trello system you have in place can also be called a Kanban Board but it just means an easily organisable To Do list. Jira has the real, grown up version of this concept

- Notify a Slack channel when something happens, for instance when a task gets completed. Developer's work and time becomes more transparent

- Easy to break a project down into smaller tasks and plan, estimate and execute it more accurately and quickly

- Gives a clear overview of the competence (or otherwise) of any developer working on the project. There is nowhere to hide in Jira

- Links to BitBucket so that code management and project management become streamlined

- You'll be able to much better understand Pecometer's Jira making your work with them easier

- If you need to hire developer resource for short or long term, they will be able to be useful straight away with less onboarding

- It's a good place to start creating proper documentation
