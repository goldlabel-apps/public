## Why WordPress?

While WordPress started as a blogging tool, it has evolved throughout the years into a powerful website builder and a robust content management system (CMS).

The best part about WordPress is that it’s easy to use and flexible enough to make different types of websites. That’s the main reason why WordPress has grown so much in popularity. According to a recent survey, WordPress powers 32.3% of all websites on the internet.

Due to its robust features, many of the top brands use WordPress to power their websites including Time Magazine, Facebook, The New Yorker, Sony, Disney, Target, The New York Times, and more.

#### Why use WordPress for your website?

The Good

1. WordPress is Free

WordPress is a free software. It means you are free to download, install, use and modify it to match your needs. You can use it to create any kind of website

WordPress is Open Source software. It is free in the sense of freedom not in the sense of free beer. You may ask what is the difference between these two?

Open source software comes with the freedom for you to use, modify, build upon, and redistribute the software in any way you like without paying any fees


The Bad

1. There might be costs involved in other areas
2. WordPress is not Easy to Customise
