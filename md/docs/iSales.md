## Internal Sales

follow this process in general and tweak it to you needs

### 1 Approach

This is simply saying hello to a new [LEAD] and asking for a conversation. The percentage of approaches which develop to the next step is important as [LEADS] are finite.

There will be a list of leads which are ready to be approached. To begin with, I'll populate this list myself and as we go on and discover what kinds of site owners are interested we can start auto-generating leads using automated searches

### 2 Build Interest

The key thing about this phase is that we do NOT mention price. The [LEAD] will ALWAYS ask 'how much' right from the start. Do not tell them.

The reason NOT to simply say 'it's $500, mate' is that until you have built up at least 500 of value it's going to sound expensive. Which it is.

The [LEAD] knows that adding a page to a website is a 5 minute job and are not going to consider that worth $5, let alont 500.

How we build value?

Ideally we approach a lead with a url or a maybe a Google search which pulls up our demo.

"Please put 'Hervey Bay River Fishing' into Google and see what comes up. Here are some of the features you are looking at. There are companies charging 1000's for the same thing. Let's do a demo. See how it works?"

If you walked into a clothes shop and a cardboard cutout twat robot AI'd you kick it in the nuts, right?
